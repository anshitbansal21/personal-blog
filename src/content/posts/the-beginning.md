## Why do I plan on doing this?
I have always liked the idea of documenting my own journey, from which I can myself reference and learn through my mistakes as I go around exploring new things. 
It also in some way makes me want to be serious about what I do as apparently public accountability works. I very frequently feel that I am not doing enough, I am hoping that through these blogs, 
I am able to understand better as I look back into these, if I made progress or not.
